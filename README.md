# Project Details

## Project Title: [Epoka club events]

## Problem Statement:
[Every year, Epoka University organizes a gathering called "Club Fest," where students can sign up for different clubs. These clubs plan a wide variety of events all year long. Nevertheless, a noticeable problem occurs following "Club Fest". The most popular method for announcing major club events is through emails, however if you sign up for a particular club, these clubs will typically use their WhatsApp groups and occasionally Instagram accounts  to announce their upcoming events. It is important to note that Epoka students are only notified about the clubs they have initially joined on “Club Fest” , so they may miss out on other club events that they could find intriguing. We consider this current method of communication to be inconvenient, as it often causes a large number of students to miss out on club activities.]

## Solution Proposed:

[Similar to how Epoka has a specific webpage where its students can view their course schedule, we are considering developing an application especially designed to manage the university club events.The presidents of each club would be able to use this app to systematically and effectively announce their own club events. The primary target group for this application would be the students , who would be able to effortlessly browse through a comprehensive list of upcoming events. They could then select and confirm their attendance for the events that align with their interests and schedule.Similar to how Epoka has a specific webpage where its students can view their course schedule, we are considering developing an application especially designed to manage the university club events.The presidents of each club would be able to use this app to systematically and effectively announce their own club events.

## Project Scope:

[The project's scope is to develop an application for students , so that they can easily attend club events in the university. They will need to sign up or login with their Epoka email addresses (@epoka.edu.al) . In the app there will be a club president page for club event management and displaying event attendance quotas for each respective event. The app will have a sorting event feature using filters to display the events . It will also include an admin page that manages all of the respective club presidents  as well as all of the events featured in the app.
The program is developed using React , Express.js  and PostgreSQL. It features a user-friendly interface where students can easily and effortlessly choose the desired event that they want to attend.Additionally the app will include a feedback system after the events finish so students are able to inform the clubs for their experiences in the events.]

- **Aim:** 
[ The aim of this project is to develop an application that simplifies event planning  for Epoka University students and club presidents.]

- **Main Objectives:**
1. [Make event management easier for Epoka University students and club presidents]
2. [Give club presidents an easy-to-use platform to post, edit, and manage events]
3. [Make it simple for students to find and participate in these events]
4. [Encourage higher engagement and participation in club activities]

## Application Description:

[ We are going to develop a web application that will help students of Epoka to be more in touch with the university's club events. We will use “react” to develop the frontend and “expressJs” to develop the backend of our application. We will also use “PostgreSQL” in order to create our databases for this project. In this application , students will be able to sign up on the platform by using their Epoka emails (@epoka.edu.al ). In the home page the events will be listed in descending order filtered by date but we plan to implement a button named ‘Filter By’ in order to help students list the events by date or club either in ascending or descending order , as they prefer. The app will have a feedback system where the students who have attended a specific club event will be able to rate it and give their feedback to the respective club presidents. The lowest rating will be 1 star and the highest rating will be 5 stars and also the students will be able to write a comment as a feedback about the event. The events will have a limited number of quotas specified by the presidents of clubs when they create the event and also in every event there will be an ‘Attend’ button and every time a student presses that button the number of quotas will go down by 1. The application will also include an admin page that is going to manage all of the respective club presidents as well as all of the events featured in the app.]
